A solution to the Word Ladder challenge by Lewis Caroll.

"Convert the word 'alice' into 'genes' in 13 steps or less,
You can only change one letter at a time,
and the new word must be in the English dictionary"

This solution is more general, allowing any word to be converted to word of the same length.
